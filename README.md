# Galardonados-IPN

This is a project from TDAW from ESCOM IPN, in this system "Galardonados" can confirm go to the event of awards. Have a Login with differents points of view for a dyrector, admin and galardonado.
The admin have a CRUD, in the point of view from director can see who have confirmed their attendance at the event.

I used a different languages and technologies of web development. These technologies are HTML, Materialize, JavaScript, CSS, PHP and SQL. The database was created and normalized to 4 normal form.

*IMPORTANT. In this project I used real data from "galardonados", so in this version the database have generic users and passwords to respect their privacy.
